1. Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project. Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

One technical concept I improved a lot in this project was using Flexbox for layout in CSS. I think of Flexbox as a way to line things up and space them out without having to guess positions or use messy margins. It helped me understand how elements can move and adjust depending on screen size. I used Flexbox in my navigation bar, hero section, and project layout so everything stayed organized and responsive.

2. Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible. Remember that your audience does not know your code nearly as well as you do so you’ll have to break it down in a logical manner for them to quickly understand it.

One part of the project that was challenging was building a hero section that matched the design while still working on different screen sizes. It was hard at first to line up the text, buttons, and images without things overlapping or breaking. I solved this by breaking the section into smaller containers and using Flexbox to control how everything aligned. Seeing it work on both desktop and mobile made me proud because it showed my layout skills had improved.

3. How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

I used AI to help me when I got stuck or wasn’t sure how to structure certain parts of my site. It helped me fix CSS issues, understand layout concepts, and come up with cleaner ways to write my code. I also used it to quickly test ideas and design changes before implementing them myself. This made development faster and helped me learn while building.
